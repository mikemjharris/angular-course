Link angualr into a database.

Need to do rails scaffold and build simple api.

Do we build an app with the class quickly or provide a seed app?  Should be pretty quick but need to practice.

Link into angualar.


rails new rails_angular
cd rails_angular
rails g scaffold Meal name:text price:float description:text 

rake db:migrate

we now have a working api!  Hurrah.  Let's see how we can interact with the server.

The controllers need additonal functionality from the angular database.  The module we want is called $http.  To inlclude it in the controller we do the following. 

 
app.controller('MarketController', ['$http', function($http){
....

we also need to add a square bracket at the end:
 }]);

when we first go to the app we want meals to be set to an empty array until we receive data from the database.

this.meals = [];

We also need to define "this" as it will change within the get request.

$http.get('http://localhost3000/meals.json').success(function(data){
  this.meals

})
